# ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Langchain - Quickstart App
```
Quickstart App built using Langchain and Streamlit
```

## Overview of the App
- Accepts input text (*e.g.* `What are 3 key advice for learning how to code?`) as prompt input using Streamlit's `st.text_area()`, then assign this to the `text` variable.
- LLM model is called via `llm()` and it is applied on the prompt input `text` to generate a response via `llm(text)`
